# Horiseon
First homework assignment. I am refactoring a website to make it more accessible. 
I made this site more accessible by adding semantic HTML. I included tags such as "<nav>", "<summary>", and "<footer>", so a screen reader would be able to detect the type of text within a container. I added an alternative text attribute (alt=) so that an alternative text is provided in case the image doesn't load properly or a description of the image is readable for electronic screen readers. Finally, an <aside> tag was included so that a screen reader would be able to detect where the item's section were oriented. I also fixed a button in the navbar that wasn't working.
