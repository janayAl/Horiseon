# Horiseon
First homework assignment. I am refactoring a website to make it more accessible. 
I made this site more accessible by adding semantic HTML. I included tags such as <nav>, <summary>, and <footer>, so a screen reader would be able to detect the type of text within a container. I added an alternative text attribute (alt=) so that an alternative text is provided in case the image doesn't load properly or a description of the image is readable for electronic screen readers. Finally, an <aside> tag was included so that a screen reader would be able to detect where the item with in it's section were oriented. In my final mock up, none of the images load, but an alternative text is provided.
